# Theme System Expansion Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to expand our theme system from just background gradients to a comprehensive theming solution that includes accent colors, component-specific styling, and potentially fonts.

## Current State

- The app currently has 4 themes: Night Sky, Beach, Sunset, and Black Hole
- Themes primarily define background gradients through the `themeGradients` object in ThemeSelector.tsx
- Theme colors are defined in themeColors.ts and organized by section (hero, about, portfolio)
- Theme selection is handled by the ThemeSelector component
- Theme state is managed at the app level in page.tsx with cookies for persistence
- ThemeType is a string union type defined in gradient.types.ts and theme.types.ts

## Phase 1: Theme System Architecture Redesign

**Status:** âœ… Completed

### Tasks:

- [x] Consolidate ThemeType definitions (currently in both gradient.types.ts and theme.types.ts)
- [x] Expand ThemeType interface to include accent colors for UI elements
- [x] Create a comprehensive theme interface that includes:
  - Background gradients
  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary accent colors
  - Text colors
  - Border colors
  - Shadow styles
- [x] Update existing theme definitions with accent colors that complement the gradients
- [x] Create a ThemeContext and Provider to make themes easily accessible throughout the app
- [x] Refactor ThemeSelector to work with the expanded theme object
- [x] Update theme persistence mechanism to handle the expanded theme object

### Completion Notes:

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive theme architecture with:

- A centralized ThemeType definition
- A robust Theme interface with typography, colors, and component styling
- A ThemeContext and Provider with utility functions for accessing theme properties
- Complete theme definitions for all four themes
- ThemeSelector, MobileView, and GradientBackground refactored to use the new system
- Cookie-based theme persistence integrated into the Context
