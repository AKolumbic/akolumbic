# Context Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation that provides context for complex features and implementations in the project. Unlike standard code documentation or comments, these context documents provide comprehensive planning, architecture decisions, implementation roadmaps, and other materials that help maintain continuity during the development of complex features.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this directory are:

1. **Implementation Context**: Provide detailed context that can be referenced during implementation of complex features
2. **Decision History**: Document architectural and design decisions for future reference
3. **Feature Roadmaps**: Break down large features into manageable phases with clear milestones
4. **Knowledge Continuity**: Ensure knowledge doesn't get lost as the project evolves

## Structure

Each major feature or implementation has its own subdirectory:

```
context-docs/
├── README.md
├── feature-name/
│   ├── FeatureRoadmap.md
│   ├── ImplementationPlan.md
│   ├── Mockups.ts
│   └── ...
└── another-feature/
    └── ...
```

## Document Types

Common document types include:

- **Roadmaps**: Overall plan for a feature, broken down into phases
- **Implementation Plans**: Detailed steps for implementing a specific phase
- **Mockups**: Code examples or interface mockups showing the intended implementation
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of component relationships
- **Decision Records**: Documentation of why certain technical decisions were made

## Current Features

- **Theme Expansion** (`/theme-expansion`): Documentation for expanding the theme system to include accent colors, component theming, and font theming

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Before Implementation**: Review relevant context docs before implementing related features
2. **During Planning**: Create context docs for any complex feature before implementation begins
3. **During Implementation**: Update docs with insights or deviations from the original plan
4. **After Completion**: Add completion notes to document any lessons learned

## Benefits

- Provides historical context for code decisions
- Makes complex features more manageable
- Helps with onboarding new developers
- Reduces the need to rediscover design patterns or implementation details
- Makes future maintenance and enhancements easier to plan
